# linkLoadr
Tool to populate a text file with Deezer links

# Disclaimer
I am not a good programmer/coder. My code is probably terrible and can be done a lot better. Don't make me more depressed than I already am.

# How to Use
Grab the exe from Releases, or compile the script yourself. Run it. Type the artist. It will try to find it. Press y or n if it found it. Do for all artists. Type exit when done. Drink copious amounts of alcohol with every use.

# Legal
linkLoadr doesn't do anything other than a GET request on Deezer's public API.

# Donate
If you like the tool, and find it really helpful, I could use a dollar or two worth of Ethereum in my wallet, because I need gas money to take out some altcoins I have.
